            <p>
                Let's talk sourdough. Fancy making ridiculously tasty bread that looks like it came from some artisan bakery, but without chaining yourself to the kitchen? You're in the right place. Forget complicated schedules and weird rituals. This is sourdough for normal people, people with jobs, kids, lives! My method is all about letting time and your starter do the heavy lifting. Simple steps, minimal faff, maximum deliciousness. Sound good? Let's get baking!

            <h3>The Basic Loaf Approach</h3>
            <p>I like to keep things simple, most of my method is completely hands-off and very flexible, letting the dough slowly ferment and develop amazing flavour while you get on with your life. Day 1 involves a quick mix, Day 2 is baking.</p>

            <h4>A Bit About Me...</h4>
            <p>
                So, who's behind Basic Loaf? Just a Dad of two based in Dublin, juggling a tech job and a serious obsession with baking. Like others, I caught the sourdough bug during lockdown, went down the rabbit hole, made some very questionable loaves (ask my family!), but eventually figured out a way that actually works without demanding my soul. I started sharing tips with friends and now I'm putting it all here. Hopefully, it helps you skip the disaster phase and get straight to the good stuff!
