            <h2>Introduction to Sourdough Bread</h2>
            <p>Sourdough bread is a type of bread that uses a natural starter culture instead of commercial yeast. It's
                known for its unique flavor and texture.</p>

            <h1>Basic Loaf: My simple guide to foolproof Sourdough bread.</h1>
            <p>
                Let's talk sourdough. Fancy making ridiculously tasty bread that looks like it came from some artisan
                bakery, but without chaining yourself to the kitchen? You're in the right place. Forget complicated
                schedules and weird rituals. This is sourdough for normal people, people with jobs, kids, lives! My
                method is all about letting time and your starter do the heavy lifting. Simple steps, minimal faff,
                maximum deliciousness. Sound good? Let's get baking!

            <h3>Who is this For?</h3>
            <p>This method is perfect for sourdough beginners, busy people or anyone previously scared off by
                complicated recipes. If you want amazing bread without stress, stick around!</p>

        <section id="overview">
            <h3>The Basic Loaf Approach</h3>
            <p>I like to keep things simple, most of my method is completely hands-off and very flexible, letting the
                dough slowly ferment and develop amazing flavour while you get on with your life. Day 1 involves a quick
                mix, Day 2 is baking.</p>

            <h4>A Bit About Me...</h4>
            <p>
                So, who's behind Basic Loaf? Just a Dad of two based in Dublin, juggling a tech job and a serious
                obsession with baking. Like others, I caught the sourdough bug during lockdown, went down the rabbit
                hole, made some very questionable loaves (ask my family!), but eventually figured out a way that
                actually works without demanding my soul. I started sharing tips with friends and now I'm putting it all
                here. Hopefully, it helps you skip the disaster phase and get straight to the good stuff!
