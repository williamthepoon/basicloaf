            <p>First of all, <strong>thank you</strong> for choosing my sourdough starter. You've just
                skipped the most challenging 14 days of the sourdough journey! This starter is <strong>over 5 years
                    old</strong>, used daily to bake for Will's family, and is incredibly resilient and reliable.</p>

            <p>Because this is a <strong>fresh</strong> starter (living and active), it needs just a little
                attention to get it ready for your first bake.</p>

                <h3>If You Collected Your Starter in Person</h3>
                <p>Since you picked this up directly, the starter is likely very happy and active.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>collected after 4pm?</strong> chances are I've already fed it for you.</li>
                    <li><strong>Baking Tomorrow?</strong> I recommend giving it a feed this evening (around 5-6pm). It
                        will then be bubbly, active, and ready to bake with first thing in the morning.</li>
                    <li><strong>Baking Later?</strong> If you aren't baking straight away, pop the jar into the fridge.
                        When you are ready to bake, take it out <strong>the day before</strong> and give it a boost.

                <h3>If You Received Your Starter by Post</h3>
                <p>Being in an envelope for 24-48 hours is a journey! Your starter might arrive
                    looking a bit thin or smelling quite "vinegary" and intense. <strong>Don't worry—it's just hungry
                        and tired.</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Feed Immediately:</strong> Treat your starter to a fresh meal. Snip the end of the zip
                        lock bag like a piping back and squeeze it into a clear, sterilized jar. Give it a "1:1:1" feed
                        (70g starter, 70g lukewarm water, 70g strong white bread
                        flour). </li>
                    <li><strong>The Sensory Check:</strong> Mix it into a <strong>thick, sticky paste</strong> (like
                        thick peanut butter). Within a few hours, you should smell a wonderful transformation: from
                        sharp vinegar to a <strong>pleasant, tangy sweetness</strong>. (See my <a
                            href="starter.html#feeding-method">Feeding Guide</a> for more).</li>
                    <li><strong>The Double Check:</strong> I recommend feeding it twice at room temperature before your
                        first bake. You want to see it reliably <strong>doubling in volume</strong> and becoming light
                        and airy, like a marshmallow.</li>
                    <li><strong>Storage:</strong> Once it's bubbly and active, it has officially moved in! You can move
                        it to the fridge and follow the standard maintenance in the <a href="starter.html">Starter
                            Guide</a>.</li>

                <h3>A Few Tips for My Specific Starter</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>It Loves Warmth:</strong> This culture is used to a cozy kitchen. If your house is cool,
                        use lukewarm water (35°C) for feedings to keep it moving.</li>
                    <li><strong>Don't Overthink It:</strong> Sourdough is resilient. If you forget a feed, just give it
                        some flour and water and it will almost always bounce back.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ready to Bake?</strong> Once your starter is bubbly and active, head over to <a

                    style="background: #e6f7ff; border-left: 4px solid #1890ff; padding: 1em; margin-top: 1em;">
                    <strong>Pro Tip: The Backup Jar</strong><br>
                    Once your starter is active, take a small spoonful (10g) and put it in a separate small jar in the
                    fridge. Don't feed it, just leave it there. This is your "insurance policy" in case anything happens
                    to your main jar!

                <h3>New Starter FAQs</h3>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h4>Is the smell normal?</h4>
                    <p>Yes! It might smell like vinegar, yeast, or even a bit fruity. This is completely normal for a
                        mature culture. Only worry if you see fuzzy mould.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h4>What if it looks liquid or thin?</h4>
                    <p>Temperature changes during travel can make the starter go thin. Simply feed it with equal parts
                        flour and water (by weight) to bring it back to a thick paste consistency.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h4>When can I bake?</h4>
                    <p>Once your starter is reliably doubling in size within 4-8 hours after a feed, you are ready to
                        bake! Check out <a href="recipe.html">The Recipe</a> to get started.</p>
