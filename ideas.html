        <h2>Beyond Toast: Ideas for Your Basic Loaf</h2>
        <p>Right, so you've baked a delicious loaf of Basic Loaf sourdough... what's next? Honestly, one of our favourite things is making simple ham and cheese toasties while the loaf is still slightly warm from the oven – the kids love it! But beyond tearing chunks off and eating it plain (also totally acceptable!), this section has a bunch of ideas for enjoying your bread, both fresh off the cooling rack and when it's starting to get a little past its prime.</p>

            <h3>Ideas for Fresh Sourdough</h3>
            <p>That first day or two is when the crust is crisp and the crumb is perfect. Make the most of it!</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Classic Toast & Butter:</strong> Don't underestimate the simple things. A thick slice, toasted just right, with lashings of good Irish butter. Perfection.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>The Humble Sandwich:</strong> Your amazing homemade bread deserves better than pre-packaged fillings. Load it up with your favourites – a classic ham & cheese, a Ploughman's, tuna mayo, egg salad, you name it. The slight tang of sourdough pairs well with almost anything.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Avocado Toast (Elevated):</strong> Mash some avocado with salt, pepper, and maybe a squeeze of lime. Spread it on toast. Now level it up: add chilli flakes, feta cheese, a poached egg, smoked salmon, cherry tomatoes, or toasted seeds.
                </li>
                 <li>
                    <strong>Fancy Toasts:</strong> Think beyond avocado. Try ricotta cheese with honey and walnuts; sautéed mushrooms with garlic and herbs; roasted tomatoes with basil; or even just good olive oil and sea salt.
                 </li>
                 <li>
                    <strong>Dipping Duty:</strong> Thick slices are perfect for mopping up hearty soups, stews, or chili. Also great with olive oil and balsamic vinegar for dipping.
                 </li>
                 <li>
                    <strong>Grilled Cheese / Toastie:</strong> Sourdough makes the *best* grilled cheese sandwiches. The sturdy crumb holds up well, and the tangy flavour complements sharp cheddar or gooey mozzarella beautifully.
                 </li>
                 <li>
                    <strong>Cheese / Charcuterie Board Star:</strong> Slice your fresh loaf and serve it alongside your favourite cheeses, cured meats, olives, and chutneys. It's the perfect vehicle for all those delicious flavours.

            <h3>Ideas for Stale(ish) Sourdough (Waste Not!)</h3>
            <p>Sourdough actually keeps quite well, but after a few days, it might start to feel a bit firm or dry. Don't throw it out! Stale sourdough is incredibly versatile. First things first, if you know you won't eat it all, check out our guide on <a href="techniques.html#freezing">Freezing Sourdough Bread</a>.</p>
            <p>But if you do have stale bread, here are some great uses:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Croutons:</strong> Cube your stale bread. For oven croutons, toss with olive oil, salt, pepper, and maybe some herbs (garlic powder, oregano), then bake in an oven (around 180°C/350°F) until golden brown and crunchy. Alternatively, pan-fry the oiled cubes in a skillet over medium heat, tossing frequently, until crisp. Perfect for salads and soups.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Breadcrumbs:</strong> Blitz dried-out stale bread in a food processor until you get crumbs. Use immediately, store in an airtight container, or freeze. Great for coating chicken/fish, topping pasta bakes, or bulking out meatballs. Panko-style (coarser) or finer crumbs both work.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>French Toast / Eggy Bread:</strong> Stale sourdough is fantastic for French toast as it soaks up the egg mixture without falling apart.
                    <ul>
                        <li><em>Sweet:</em> Dip thick slices in a mix of beaten egg, milk, cinnamon, and a touch of vanilla. Fry in butter until golden brown. Serve with maple syrup, fruit, yogurt, etc.</li>
                        <li><em>Savoury:</em> Dip slices in beaten egg with salt and pepper (maybe a splash of milk). Fry in butter or oil. Great with bacon, mushrooms, cheese, or ketchup!</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Panzanella (Italian Bread Salad):</strong> Tear stale bread into chunks. Toast them lightly (optional). Combine with ripe tomatoes, cucumber, red onion, basil, and a simple vinaigrette dressing. Let it sit for a bit for the bread to soak up the juices. Delicious in summer.
                </li>
                 <li>
                    <strong>Bread Pudding:</strong> Cube stale bread and soak in a custard mixture (eggs, milk/cream, sugar, vanilla for sweet; eggs, milk/stock, cheese, herbs for savoury). Bake until set and golden. A great comfort food dessert or even a savoury main course.
                 </li>
                 <li>
                    <strong>Toasted for Dipping:</strong> Even if it's a bit dry, slicing and toasting stale sourdough makes it perfect again for dipping in soups or soft-boiled eggs.
                 </li>
            </ul>
