        <h2>Beyond Toast: Ideas for Your Basic Loaf</h2>
        <p>Right, so you've baked a delicious loaf of Basic Loaf sourdough... what's next? Honestly, one of our favourite things is making simple ham and cheese toasties while the loaf is still slightly warm from the oven – the kids love it! But beyond tearing chunks off and eating it plain (also totally acceptable!), this section has a bunch of ideas for enjoying your bread, both fresh off the cooling rack and when it's starting to get a little past its prime.</p>

            <h3>Ideas for Fresh Sourdough</h3>
            <p>That first day or two is when the crust is crisp and the crumb is perfect. Make the most of it!</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Classic Toast & Butter:</strong> Don't underestimate the simple things. A thick slice, toasted just right, with lashings of good Irish butter. Perfection.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>The Humble Sandwich:</strong> Your amazing homemade bread deserves better than pre-packaged fillings. Load it up with your favourites – a classic ham & cheese, a Ploughman's, tuna mayo, egg salad, you name it. The slight tang of sourdough pairs well with almost anything.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Avocado Toast (Elevated):</strong> Mash some avocado with salt, pepper, and maybe a squeeze of lime. Spread it on toast. Now level it up: add chilli flakes, feta cheese, a poached egg, smoked salmon, cherry tomatoes, or toasted seeds.
                </li>
                 <li>
                    <strong>Fancy Toasts:</strong> Think beyond avocado. Try ricotta cheese with honey and walnuts; sautéed mushrooms with garlic and herbs; roasted tomatoes with basil; or even just good olive oil and sea salt.
                 </li>
                 <li>
                    <strong>Dipping Duty:</strong> Thick slices are perfect for mopping up hearty soups, stews, or chili. Also great with olive oil and balsamic vinegar for dipping.
                 </li>
                 <li>
                    <strong>Grilled Cheese / Toastie:</strong> Sourdough makes the *best* grilled cheese sandwiches. The sturdy crumb holds up well, and the tangy flavour complements sharp cheddar or gooey mozzarella beautifully.
                 </li>
                 <li>
                    <strong>Cheese / Charcuterie Board Star:</strong> Slice your fresh loaf and serve it alongside your favourite cheeses, cured meats, olives, and chutneys. It's the perfect vehicle for all those delicious flavours.

            <h3>Creative Uses for Stale Sourdough Bread</h3>
            <p>Sourdough actually keeps quite well, but after a few days, it might start to feel a bit firm or dry. Don't throw it out! Stale sourdough is incredibly versatile. First, if you know you won't eat it all, check out our guide on <a href="techniques.html#freezing">Freezing Sourdough Bread</a>.</p>
            <p>But if you do have stale bread, here are some great uses:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Homemade Croutons:</strong> Cube stale bread. For oven croutons, toss with olive oil, salt, pepper, garlic powder, and herbs (oregano/rosemary work well). Bake at 180°C/350°F until golden and crunchy. For a quicker version, pan-fry the oiled cubes in a skillet over medium heat, tossing frequently until crisp.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Versatile Breadcrumbs:</strong> Blitz dried-out stale bread in a food processor until you get crumbs. For "fresh" breadcrumbs (good for stuffing), use bread that's just a day or two old. For dried crumbs, toast the bread slices in a low oven first until completely dry, then blitz. Store in an airtight container or freeze.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>The Best French Toast:</strong> Stale sourdough is fantastic for French toast as it soaks up the egg mixture without falling apart.
                    <ul>
                        <li><em>Sweet:</em> For two slices, whisk 1 egg, a splash of milk (about 60ml), 1/2 tsp vanilla extract, and 1/2 tsp cinnamon. Dip thick slices until saturated but not soggy. Fry in butter over medium heat until golden brown.</li>
                        <li><em>Savoury:</em> Whisk 1 egg with a splash of milk, salt, and pepper. Dip and fry as above. Great with bacon, mushrooms, or melted cheese on top.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Panzanella (Tuscan Bread Salad):</strong> Tear stale bread into chunks. Toast lightly. Combine in a large bowl with ripe chopped tomatoes, cucumber, thinly sliced red onion, and lots of fresh basil. Whisk together olive oil, red wine vinegar, salt, and pepper for a simple vinaigrette. Pour over, toss gently, and let it sit for at least 20 minutes for the bread to soak up the juices.
                </li>
                 <li>
                    <strong>Bruschetta or Crostini:</strong> Slice the loaf, brush with olive oil, and toast or grill until crisp. Rub a raw garlic clove over the surface while warm. Top with anything you like: chopped tomatoes and basil, goat cheese and roasted peppers, or white bean dip.
                 </li>
                 <li>
                    <strong>Ribollita (Tuscan Bean & Bread Soup):</strong> A classic rustic soup. The basic idea is to make a hearty vegetable and bean soup (with things like cannellini beans, kale, carrots, celery, onion, tomatoes). You then layer slices of stale sourdough in serving bowls and ladle the hot soup over the top, letting the bread soak it all up.
                 </li>
                 <li>
                    <strong>Stuffing or Dressing:</strong> The firm texture of stale sourdough makes it a fantastic base for stuffing. Cube the bread and let it dry out a bit more if needed. Sauté onions and celery, then combine with the bread cubes, herbs like sage and thyme, and chicken or vegetable stock.
                 </li>
                 <li>
                    <strong>Savory Strata:</strong> A strata is like a savoury bread pudding. Layer stale bread cubes in a baking dish with cheese, cooked vegetables (like spinach, mushrooms, or peppers), and maybe some sausage or bacon. Pour a mixture of eggs and milk over everything and let it soak for a while before baking until golden and set.
                 </li>
                 <li>
                    <strong>Fondue Dippers:</strong> If you're having a cheese fondue night, sturdy cubes of toasted stale sourdough are the absolute best for dipping. They hold their shape and have enough flavour to stand up to the cheese.
                 </li>
