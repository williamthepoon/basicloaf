            <h1>The Basic Loaf: Foolproof Sourdough Recipe</h1>
            <p>This is it. The master recipe. It's built to be flexible because life rarely goes exactly to plan. The
                long fermentation time does all the heavy lifting for flavor, so you don't have to work hard.</p>

                        bread flour gives the best structure. Starter amount can vary slightly based on its activity and
                        your room temperature. See our <a href="gear.html">essential gear guide</a> for more details.

                    is just baking. You can adjust the timing to fit your schedule.</p>

                    <li id="step-day1-mix">
                        <strong>Combine Ingredients (Morning):</strong> In a large bowl, combine your <strong>100-125g active starter</strong> with <strong>180g lukewarm water</strong> and mix well until the starter is fully dissolved and the mixture looks milky.
                        <img src="images/starter-water-mixed.jpg"

                        <p>Then add <strong>5g salt</strong> and the <strong>280g strong bread flour</strong>.
                        Use your hands or a sturdy spoon to mix everything roughly until no dry flour remains. The dough will
                        look shaggy and rough - like a messy tangle of sticky, uneven clumps with no smooth surface. This is exactly what you want!</p>

                    </li>
                    <li id="step-day1-rest">
                        <strong>Short Rest &amp; Mix:</strong> Let the covered bowl sit for about <strong>10-15 minutes</strong>. Then, spend just <strong>1 minute</strong> using wet hands to gently fold the dough over itself in the bowl, or use
                        your spoon/spatula to bring it together. It doesn't need kneading - you're just making sure
                        everything comes together a bit more than that rough mess from earlier. Cover again.
                    </li>
                    <li id="step-day1-bulk">
                        <strong>Bulk Fermentation (The Wait):</strong> Now, leave the covered
                        bowl at room temperature. We're looking for the dough to grow and become airy.
                        <p><strong>Temperature affects timing:</strong> In a warm kitchen <strong>(22°C/72°F)</strong>, bulk fermentation might take <strong>5-6 hours</strong>.
                        In a cooler kitchen <strong>(18°C/64°F)</strong>, it could take <strong>8-10 hours</strong>. Time is a guide, but the dough's appearance tells you when it's actually ready.</p>
                        <p><strong>Signs it's ready:</strong> The surface looks smooth and bubbly, the dough wobbles when you gently shake the bowl,
                        and it has increased in size by about <strong>50-75%</strong>.</p>
                        <p><strong>Stretch &amp; Folds:</strong> During the first <strong>3-4 hours</strong> of fermentation, do at least <strong>2 sets</strong> of stretch and folds (<strong>3-4 sets</strong> is even better if you have time). This helps build structure and makes shaping easier later. <a href="advice.html#stretch-fold">See the full technique guide</a>. With wet hands, reach under one side of the dough, gently stretch it upwards, and fold it over the top. Rotate the bowl 90 degrees and repeat 3 more times (total <strong>4 stretches/folds per set</strong>). Wait <strong>45-60 minutes</strong> between sets.</p>

                        <p>Want to check your gluten development? Try the windowpane test: after your last set, take a small piece of dough and gently stretch it between your fingers. If it stretches thin enough to see light through without tearing, you've got good gluten development. <a href="advice.html#windowpane">Learn more about the windowpane test</a>.</p>

                        <strong>Shape:</strong> Once the dough looks ready (increased size), it's time to shape. Handle the dough gently to preserve the air bubbles you've worked so hard to create!

                            <li>Gently tip the dough out onto a lightly floured worktop</li>

                            <li>Cup your hands around the dough and gently rotate it on the counter to create surface tension and form a round ball (boule) or an oval (batard)</li>

                        <strong>Prepare Banneton &amp; Final Proof Prep:</strong> Generously dust your banneton (or a
                        medium bowl lined with a clean, non-fluffy tea towel) with rice flour. Rice flour is key as it
                        doesn't absorb moisture like regular flour, preventing sticking. If you don't have rice flour, regular bread flour works too - just use a bit more.
                        <p><strong>CRITICAL: Gently place the shaped dough into the banneton with the SEAM SIDE UP.</strong> This is important! When you flip it out for baking, the seam side will be on the bottom, and the smooth side will be on top for scoring. Getting this wrong means you'll be trying to score the seamy bottom, which doesn't work well.</p>

                        <strong>Counter Proof:</strong> Cover the banneton (a plastic bag or shower cap works well).
                        Leave it on your worktop at room temperature for <strong>1-2 hours</strong>. The dough should rise a bit more in the banneton and feel lighter and airier when you gently touch the surface. You'll know it's ready when it springs back slowly if you press it gently with a floured finger - it shouldn't feel dense or tight.

                    <li id="step-day1-cold">
                        <strong>Cold Proof (Overnight):</strong> Transfer the covered banneton to the fridge. This is where the recipe really works with your schedule. You can bake it after <strong>8 hours</strong>, or leave it for <strong>12</strong>, <strong>16</strong>, even <strong>24 hours</strong>. Life happens, and this dough waits patiently while developing deeper flavor. Bake it when you're ready.

                        <strong>Preheat Oven &amp; Dutch Oven:</strong> When you're ready to bake, place your <a
                            href="gear.html#must-haves">Dutch oven</a>
                        (with its lid on) inside your main oven. Preheat the oven to <strong>235°C (455°F)</strong>. It's crucial the
                        Dutch oven gets incredibly hot, so let it preheat for at least <strong>20 minutes</strong> <em>after</em> the
                        oven reaches temperature (<strong>30-40 minutes</strong> total preheat time is ideal).
                        <p><strong>Safety warning:</strong> The Dutch oven will be extremely hot! Use thick oven gloves and work carefully.</p>

                    <li id="step-day2-prep">
                        <strong>Prepare Dough for Baking:</strong> Just before you bake, take the banneton out of the
                        fridge. Place a piece of baking parchment paper over the top of the banneton.
                        <p>Now for the flip: Place one hand flat on top of the parchment paper to hold it in place, and use your other hand to support the bottom of the banneton. In one smooth motion, flip the whole thing over so the dough releases onto the parchment paper. Lift off the banneton/bowl.</p>

                    <li id="step-day2-score">
                        <strong>Score the Loaf:</strong> Using a baker's lame or a sharp knife, make one confident,
                        decisive score across the top of the loaf (about <strong>1-2 cm</strong> or <strong>1/2 inch deep</strong>). A simple curve or a
                        cross works well for beginners. This allows the bread to expand when baking. <a

                        <p>Now for the hardest part: let it cool completely! This takes <em>at least</em> <strong>30 to 45 minutes</strong> - the inside is still cooking and setting even after you remove it from the oven.
                        Slicing into hot bread will result in a gummy, doughy texture because the structure hasn't fully set. The starches need time to crystallize and the moisture needs to redistribute. Wait, and you'll get the texture you actually want.</p>
