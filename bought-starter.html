            <h1>Welcome to the Basic Loaf Family!</h1>
            <p>First of all, <strong>thank you</strong> for buying a portion of my sourdough starter. You've just
                skipped the hardest 14 days of the sourdough journey! This starter is mature, active, and ready to help
                you bake incredible bread.</p>

            <p>Because this is a <strong>fresh</strong> starter (not dried), it's a living culture that needs a little
                attention depending on how it got to you.</p>

                <h3>If You Collected Your Starter in Person</h3>
                <p>Since you picked this up directly, the starter is likely very happy and active.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Baking Today?</strong> If I gave it to you freshly fed, you can use it as soon as it
                        peaks (doubles in size). Check the <a href="starter.html#readiness-signs">Signs of Readiness</a>.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Baking Later?</strong> If you aren't baking in the next few hours, pop the jar straight
                        into the fridge. It will stay happy there for up to a week before it needs a feed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Maintenance:</strong> When you are ready to bake, follow my <a
                            href="starter.html#feeding-method">Scrapings Feeding Method</a> to build up the amount you
                        need.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>If You Received Your Starter by Post</h3>
                <p>Being in a dark box for 24-48 hours can be a little stressful for the yeast. It might look a bit
                    liquid, have a few bubbles, or smell quite "vinegary" or strong. This is completely normal!</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Feed Immediately:</strong> As soon as you open it, transfer the starter to a clean glass
                        jar. Give it a "1:1:1" feed (e.g., 50g starter, 50g lukewarm water, 50g strong white bread
                        flour).</li>
                    <li><strong>Let it Wake Up:</strong> Leave it at room temperature. It should start bubbling and
                        rising within a few hours.</li>
                    <li><strong>The "Double Check":</strong> I recommend feeding it twice at room temperature before
                        your first bake to ensure it's back to full strength. Once it's reliably doubling in 4-6 hours,
                        it's ready!</li>
                    <li><strong>Storage:</strong> Once active, you can move it to the fridge and follow the standard
                        maintenance in the <a href="starter.html">Starter Guide</a>.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>A Few Tips for My Specific Starter</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>It Loves Warmth:</strong> This culture is used to a cozy kitchen. If your house is cool,
                        use lukewarm water (35°C) for feedings to keep it moving.</li>
                    <li><strong>Don't Overthink It:</strong> Sourdough is resilient. If you forget a feed, just give it
                        some flour and water and it will almost always bounce back.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ready to Bake?</strong> Once your starter is bubbly and active, head over to <a
