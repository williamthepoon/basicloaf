        <h1>Sourdough Starter Guide: Keeping Your Culture Happy</h1>
        <p>Let's dive into the heart of sourdough: the starter. Think of it as a living culture of wild yeast and
            bacteria in a jar, responsible for making your bread rise and giving it that unique flavour. This guide
            covers feeding, readiness signs, temperature, strengthening, troubleshooting, and how to create one from
            scratch.</p>

            <h3>My Simple 'Scrapings' Feeding Method (No Waste!)</h3>
            <p>A common concern with sourdough is discarding starter during feedings, which can feel wasteful. This
                method avoids that completely! **We don't discard.** Instead, we utilize the small amount of starter
                naturally left clinging to the jar after using most of it for baking.</p>
            <p>This keeps your starter active and ready without accumulating excess discard. (If you don't have an
                active starter yet, jump down to learn how to <a href="#create-from-scratch">create one from scratch</a>
                first!)</p>
            <h4>How to Feed Your Starter Using the Scrapings Method</h4>
            <p>Once your starter is established and active, you can switch to this method. You'll typically feed your
                starter after using most of it for baking. If storing it in the fridge between bakes, feeding about once
                a week is usually sufficient. If kept at room temperature, it requires more frequent feeding (often
                daily).</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Prepare:</strong> You need your starter jar (with just the scrapings left inside), your
                    digital scale, 50g lukewarm water (around 35-40°C / 95-104°F), and 50g strong white bread flour. Top
                    tip - use a chopstick to stir it up!

                        alt="Glass jar showing small amount of sourdough starter scrapings at the bottom">
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Add Water &amp; Swirl:</strong> Pour the 50g of water into the jar with the scrapings. Give
                    it a good swirl or stir to loosen the old starter bits. It should resemble milky water.

                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Add Flour:</strong> Add the 50g of strong white bread flour.

                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Mix Thoroughly:</strong> Stir well, ensuring no dry flour remains. The target consistency is
                    a **thick paste**, like peanut butter or thick yoghurt.

                </li>
                <li><strong>Cover Loosely:</strong> Rest the lid on top or use cling film with holes.</li>
                <li><strong>Let it Rise:</strong> Leave at room temperature. It should get bubbly and rise (ideally
                    double) in 4-12 hours, depending on temp/vigour.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>And that's the process! It's a straightforward, no-discard method that feeds the remaining starter
                effectively.</p>

            <h3>Is My Starter Ready to Bake With? Signs of Activity</h3>
            <p>Readiness is about activity, not just age. Here’s what to look for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Significant Rise (Doubling):</strong> Reliably doubles (or more) in volume within 4-8 hours
                    after feeding at room temperature. Use a marker/band on the jar to track.</li>
                <li><strong>Lots of Bubbles:</strong> Visibly bubbly and airy throughout, like a sponge.</li>
                <li><strong>Predictable Pattern:</strong> Rises, peaks, and falls predictably after feeding. Use near
                    its peak.</li>
                <li><strong>Pleasant Smell:</strong> Smells pleasantly sour and yeasty. Not strongly unpleasant.</li>
                <li><strong>(Optional) Float Test:</strong> A spoonful dropped in water floats if ready. Not always 100%
                    reliable; visual cues are often better.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Remember Temperature &amp; Patience!</strong> Temperature greatly affects timing. It often takes
                <strong>10-14 days (or more!)</strong> to establish a strong starter. Be patient!</p>

        <section id="temperature-effects">
            <h3>Why Temperature Matters (A Lot!)</h3>
            <p>Your starter's yeast and bacteria work at different speeds depending on warmth. Understanding this helps
                predict behaviour.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Warm (e.g., 24-28°C / 75-82°F):</strong> Faster activity, quicker rise/peak, needs more
                    frequent feeding if kept out. Can increase tanginess.</li>
                <li><strong>Cooler Room Temp (e.g., 18-21°C / 65-70°F):</strong> Slower activity, longer rise/peak.
                    Don't mistake slowness for weakness!</li>
                <li><strong>Fridge Temp (e.g., 4-5°C / 39-41°F):</strong> Very slow activity. Ideal for storage (weekly
                    feeding). Needs feeding(s) at room temp to wake up before baking.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>The Takeaway:</strong> Aim for consistency. Use slightly warmer water for feeding if your kitchen
                is cool. Find a stable spot. Patience is key!</p>

            <h3>How to Strengthen Your Starter</h3>
            <p>If your starter has been dormant in the fridge for a while, or seems a bit sluggish, it's a good idea to
                give it a boost before you plan to bake. A stronger starter means a better rise in your final loaf. The
                key is consistent feeding in a warm environment.</p>
            <h4>The Process:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Wake It Up:</strong> If your starter lives in the fridge, take it out. If there's any dark
                    liquid (hooch) on top, pour it off. Let the starter sit at room temperature for an hour or two. The
                    amount of starter in your jar will determine how long it will get to room temperature. If you're
                    only storing the bare minimum using the scrapings method, then it will come up to temperature
                    relatively quickly. This is the way I store my sourdough in the fridge.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Give it a Feed:</strong> Perform one regular feed. Leave it at room temperature.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Feed Again:</strong> When the starter has risen to double it's height, feed again, don't go
                    by time as this can make your starter weaker, not stronger. You want to try and feed the starter at
                    it's peak. This back-to-back feeding builds up the yeast population and makes the culture more
                    vigorous.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>(Optional) A Third Feed:</strong> For a very strong starter, you can repeat the process one
                    more time, giving it a third feed at it's peak.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>After 2-3 consecutive feedings like this at room temperature, your starter should be incredibly active,
                bubbly, and doubling in volume quickly after a feed. This is the perfect time to use it in your recipe
                for a great oven spring!</p>

            <h3>Creating Your Starter From Scratch (If You Need One!)</h3>
            <p>Don't have a starter yet? It's easier than you think, but requires patience (often 10-14 days, sometimes
                more!). This is a common method.</p>
            <h4>What You'll Need:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Clean glass jar (0.5-1 litre)</li>
                <li>Digital Kitchen Scale</li>
                <li>Flour: Whole Wheat or Rye flour recommended for Day 1, Strong White Bread Flour for subsequent
                    feedings.</li>
                <li>Water: Filtered or dechlorinated tap water (lukewarm initially).</li>
                <li>Stirring utensil.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>The Day-by-Day Process:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Day 1: Initial Mix</strong><br> Combine 50g Whole Wheat/Rye flour + 50g lukewarm water. Mix
                    to thick paste. Cover loosely, leave 24h.</li>
                <li><strong>Day 2: First Feed</strong><br> Discard most (leave ~50g). Add 50g Strong White Flour + 50g
                    water. Mix, cover, leave 24h.</li>
                <li><strong>Day 3 &amp; Onwards:</strong> Continue the daily discard/feed routine. Look for the <a
                        href="#readiness-signs">Signs of Readiness</a>. Once it's reliably active for 2-3 days in a row,
                    it's ready!</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Note:</strong> Ignore funky smells unless it's fuzzy mould (pink/orange/black) – discard
                immediately if mould appears.</p>

            <h3>Troubleshooting Common Starter Issues</h3>
            <p>Sometimes starters do slightly odd things. Don't panic! Here's how to handle common scenarios:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h4>Problem: Dark Liquid Layer on Top ("Hooch")</h4>
                    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Your starter is hungry. Simply **pour the hooch off** before feeding
                        as usual. If it happens often, feed more frequently.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Problem: Sluggish / Not Rising Much</h4>
                    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> **Be patient!** Ensure it's in a warm spot and getting fed regularly.
                        Consistency with strong white bread flour is key.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Problem: Runny Consistency</h4>
                    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Double-check your measurements by weight. The target is a **thick
                        paste**. If it's too thin, pour most off and feed again.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Problem: Funky Smells (Acetone, Vinegar, etc.)</h4>
                    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Generally, **ignore the smells unless you see visible mould**. If it
                        smells strongly acidic, it's just hungry. Feed it. **BUT, if you see any pink, orange, or black
                        fuzzy spots – discard immediately and start over.**</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Remember, patience and consistent feeding are the best tools for most starter issues!</p>
