# Basic Loaf - TODO

## Active Work
- Monitor GSC for canonical/duplicate issues to clear after 2026-02-11 SEO fixes
- Request indexing for troubleshooting.html in GSC

## High Priority
- Build backlinks - participate in r/sourdough and r/Breadit, get mentioned in food blog roundups
- Implement server-side redirects for old /techniques and /tips URLs (still showing impressions in GSC)
- Add lazy loading for below-fold images
- Conduct WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility audit (currently Level A)

## Medium Priority
- Add analytics/tracking for video views
- Convert remaining JPGs to WebP with fallbacks
- Create custom 404 page
- Expand recipe content to include sourdough pizza dough, chocolate sourdough, and other sourdough-based recipes
- Add "related articles" cards at bottom of each page (improves internal linking further)

## Low Priority
- Add seasonal sourdough variations (whole wheat, spelt, rye)
- Create printable recipe PDFs
- Create downloadable sourdough diary guide PDF
