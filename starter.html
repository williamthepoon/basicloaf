        <h2>Sourdough Starter Guide: Keeping Your Culture Healthy</h2>
        <p>Let's dive into the heart of sourdough: the starter. Think of it as a living culture of wild yeast and bacteria in a jar, responsible for making your bread rise and giving it that unique flavour. While it might sound complex, the approach here focuses on simplicity, avoiding common frustrations like excessive discarding and rigid schedules.</p>

        <section id="feeding-method">
            <h3>My Simple 'Scrapings' Feeding Method (No Waste!)</h3>
            <p>A common concern with sourdough is discarding starter during feedings, which can feel wasteful. The good news is this method avoids that completely! **We don't discard.** Instead, we utilize the small amount of starter naturally left clinging to the jar after using most of it for baking.</p>
            <p>This keeps your starter active and ready without accumulating excess discard.</p>

            <h4>How to Feed Your Starter Using the Scrapings Method</h4>
            <p>You'll typically feed your starter after using most of it for baking. If storing it in the fridge between bakes, feeding about once a week is usually sufficient (more on storage later). If kept at room temperature, it requires more frequent feeding (often daily).</p>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Prepare:</strong> You need your starter jar (containing only the residual scrapings – roughly 5-10g is fine, precision isn't critical here), your digital scale, 50g lukewarm water (around 35-40°C / 95-104°F), and 50g strong white bread flour.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Add Water & Swirl:</strong> Pour the 50g of water into the jar with the scrapings. Give it a good swirl or stir with a clean spoon/spatula to loosen the old starter bits into the water. It should resemble milky water.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Add Flour:</strong> Add the 50g of strong white bread flour to the jar.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Mix Thoroughly:</strong> Stir everything together well, ensuring no dry flour remains. The target consistency is a thick paste, similar to peanut butter. A small silicone spatula or chopstick helps reach the corners.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Cover Loosely:</strong> Place the lid back on the jar but don't tighten it completely – the culture needs to release gas as it ferments. Resting the lid on top or using cling film with holes works well.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Let it Rise:</strong> Leave the jar at room temperature (a spot that's consistently warm but not hot is ideal). Over the next several hours (typically 4-12 hours, depending on temperature and starter vigour), it should become bubbly and increase in volume, ideally doubling or more. This indicates it's active and ready for baking (or ready for the fridge if storing).
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>And that's the process! It's a straightforward, no-discard method that feeds the remaining starter effectively. This feeding ratio (roughly 1 part residual starter to 5 parts water and 5 parts flour by weight) provides ample nourishment for the culture to become active.</p>
