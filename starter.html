        <h2>Sourdough Starter Guide: Keeping Your Bubbly Beast Happy</h2>
        <p>Alright, let's talk about the heart and soul of sourdough – the starter! It's basically a bubbly pet you keep in a jar, full of wild yeast and bacteria that make your bread rise and taste amazing. Sounds complicated? Nah. Forget everything you've heard about endless discarding and complicated feeding schedules. We do things the simple way around here.</p>

        <section id="feeding-method">
            <h3>My Simple 'Scrapings' Feeding Method (No Waste!)</h3>
            <p>One of the biggest turn-offs for potential sourdough bakers is the idea of constantly throwing away perfectly good starter (the 'discard'). It feels wasteful, right? Well, good news – with this method, **we don't discard anything!** We simply use the tiny bit of starter left clinging to the sides of the jar after we've used most of it for baking.</p>
            <p>This keeps your starter lean, mean, and ready for action without filling your fridge with jars of discard you feel guilty about.</p>

            <h4>How to Feed Your Starter (The Basic Loaf Way)</h4>
            <p>You'll typically feed your starter after you've used most of it to bake a loaf, or roughly once a week if you store it in the fridge between bakes (more on storage later!). If you keep it at room temperature, you'll feed it more often (usually daily).</p>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Grab Your Gear:</strong> You need your starter jar (with just the scrapings left inside – maybe 5-10g, don't stress the exact amount), your digital scale, 50g lukewarm water (around 35-40°C / 95-104°F), and 50g strong white bread flour.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Add Water & Swirl:</strong> Pour the 50g of water into the jar with the scrapings. Give it a good swirl or stir with a clean spoon/spatula to loosen the old starter bits into the water. It'll look like milky water.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Add Flour:</strong> Add the 50g of strong white bread flour to the jar.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Mix It Up:</strong> Stir everything together thoroughly until there are no dry bits of flour left. Aim for the consistency of thick paste or peanut butter. A small silicone spatula or chopstick works great for getting into the corners.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Cover Loosely:</strong> Place the lid back on the jar but don't tighten it completely – your starter needs to breathe a little as it creates gas. You can just rest the lid on top or use cling film with a few holes poked in it.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Let it Rise:</strong> Leave the jar at room temperature (ideally somewhere reasonably warm, like near but not *on* a radiator, or just on the counter). Over the next several hours (typically 4-12 hours depending on temperature and starter strength), it should bubble up and hopefully double (or more) in size. This means it's active and ready to use for baking (or ready to go back in the fridge if you're not baking soon).
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>That's it! Simple, right? No discard, just feeding the little bit that's left. This 1:?:? ratio (roughly 1 part leftover starter to 5 parts water and 5 parts flour, since 50:50 is 10x the typical 5g scraping) gives it plenty of food to get active.</p>
