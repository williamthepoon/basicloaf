                <h3>My Simple 'Scrapings' Feeding Method (No Waste!)</h3>
                <p>Many guides tell you to throw away half your starter every time you feed it. I hate waste, so we
                    don't do
                    that. We use the "Scrapings Method". Essentially, you keep a tiny amount in the jar (the scrapings),
                    and
                    only build it up when you want to bake.</p>
                <p>This keeps your starter active and ready without accumulating excess discard. (If you don't have an
                    active starter yet, jump down to learn how to <a href="#create-from-scratch">create one from
                        scratch</a>
                    first!)</p>
                <h4>How to Feed Your Starter Using the Scrapings Method</h4>
                <p>Once your starter is established and active, you can switch to this method. You'll typically feed
                    your
                    starter after using most of it for baking. If storing it in the fridge between bakes, feeding about
                    once
                    a week is usually sufficient. If kept at room temperature, it requires more frequent feeding (often
                    daily).</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Prepare:</strong> You need your starter jar (with just the scrapings left inside), your
                        digital scale, 50g lukewarm water (around 35-40°C / 95-104°F), and 50g strong white bread flour.
                        Top
                        tip - use a chopstick to stir it up!

                        Give
                        it a good swirl or stir to loosen the old starter bits. It should resemble milky water.

                        consistency is
                        a <strong>thick paste</strong>, like peanut butter or thick yoghurt.

                    <li><strong>Cover Loosely:</strong> Rest the lid on top or use cling film with holes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Let it Rise:</strong> Leave at room temperature. It should get bubbly and rise (ideally
                        double) in 4-12 hours, depending on temp/vigour.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>And that's the process! It's a straightforward, no-discard method that feeds the remaining starter
                    effectively.</p>

                <h3>Is My Starter Ready to Bake With? Signs of Activity</h3>
                <p>Readiness is about activity, not just age. Here’s what to look for:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Significant Rise (Doubling):</strong> Reliably doubles (or more) in volume within 4-8
                        hours
                        after feeding at room temperature. Use a marker/band on the jar to track.</li>
                    <li><strong>Lots of Bubbles:</strong> Visibly bubbly and airy throughout, like a sponge.</li>
                    <li><strong>Predictable Pattern:</strong> Rises, peaks, and falls predictably after feeding. Use
                        near
                        its peak.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pleasant Smell:</strong> Smells pleasantly sour and yeasty. Not strongly unpleasant.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>(Optional) Float Test:</strong> A spoonful dropped in water floats if ready. Not always
                        100%
                        reliable; visual cues are often better.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Remember Temperature &amp; Patience!</strong> Temperature greatly affects timing. It often
                    takes
                    <strong>10-14 days (or more!)</strong> to establish a strong starter. Be patient!

            <section id="temperature-effects">
                <h3>Why Temperature Matters (A Lot!)</h3>
                <p>Your starter's yeast and bacteria work at different speeds depending on warmth. Understanding this
                    helps
                    predict behaviour.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Warm (e.g., 24-28°C / 75-82°F):</strong> Faster activity, quicker rise/peak, needs more
                        frequent feeding if kept out. Can increase tanginess.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cooler Room Temp (e.g., 18-21°C / 65-70°F):</strong> Slower activity, longer rise/peak.
                        Don't mistake slowness for weakness!</li>
                    <li><strong>Fridge Temp (e.g., 4-5°C / 39-41°F):</strong> Very slow activity. Ideal for storage
                        (weekly
                        feeding). Needs feeding(s) at room temp to wake up before baking.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>The Takeaway:</strong> Aim for consistency. Use slightly warmer water for feeding if your
                    kitchen
                    is cool. Find a stable spot. Patience is key!</p>

            <section id="strengthening-starter">
                <h3>How to Strengthen Your Starter</h3>
                <p>If your starter has been dormant in the fridge for a while, or seems a bit sluggish, it's a good idea
                    to
                    give it a boost before you plan to bake. A stronger starter means a better rise in your final loaf.
                    The
                    key is consistent feeding in a warm environment.</p>
                <h4>The Process:</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Wake It Up:</strong> If your starter lives in the fridge, take it out. If there's any
                        dark
                        liquid (hooch) on top, pour it off. Let the starter sit at room temperature for an hour or two.
                        The
                        amount of starter in your jar will determine how long it will get to room temperature. If you're
                        only storing the bare minimum using the scrapings method, then it will come up to temperature
                        relatively quickly. This is the way I store my sourdough in the fridge.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Give it a Feed:</strong> Perform one regular feed. Leave it at room temperature.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Feed Again:</strong> When the starter has risen to double it's height, feed again, don't
                        go
                        by time as this can make your starter weaker, not stronger. You want to try and feed the starter
                        at
                        it's peak. This back-to-back feeding builds up the yeast population and makes the culture more
                        vigorous.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>(Optional) A Third Feed:</strong> For a very strong starter, you can repeat the process
                        one
                        more time, giving it a third feed at it's peak.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>After 2-3 consecutive feedings like this at room temperature, your starter should be incredibly
                    active,
                    bubbly, and doubling in volume quickly after a feed. This is the perfect time to use it in your
                    recipe
                    for a great oven spring!</p>

                <h3>Creating Your Starter From Scratch (If You Need One!)</h3>
                <p>Don't have a starter yet? It's easier than you think, but requires patience (often 10-14 days,
                    sometimes
                    more!). This is a common method.</p>
                <h4>What You'll Need:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Clean glass jar (0.5-1 litre)</li>
                    <li>Digital Kitchen Scale</li>
                    <li>Flour: Whole Wheat or Rye flour recommended for Day 1, Strong White Bread Flour for subsequent
                        feedings.</li>
                    <li>Water: Filtered or dechlorinated tap water (lukewarm initially).</li>
                    <li>Stirring utensil.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>The Day-by-Day Process:</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Day 1: Initial Mix</strong><br> Combine 50g Whole Wheat/Rye flour + 50g lukewarm water.
                        Mix
                        to thick paste. Cover loosely, leave 24h.</li>
                    <li><strong>Day 2: First Feed</strong><br> Discard most (leave ~50g). Add 50g Strong White Flour +
                        50g
                        water. Mix, cover, leave 24h.</li>
                    <li><strong>Day 3 &amp; Onwards:</strong> Continue the daily discard/feed routine. Look for the <a
                            href="#readiness-signs">Signs of Readiness</a>. Once it's reliably active for 2-3 days in a
                        row,
                        it's ready!</li>

                <p><strong>Note:</strong> Ignore funky smells unless it's fuzzy mould (pink/orange/black) – discard
                    immediately if mould appears.</p>

                <h3>Troubleshooting Common Issues</h3>
                <p>Starters are resilient. They are hard to kill, so don't worry if yours looks a bit sad. Here are the
                    common fixes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Problem: Dark Liquid Layer on Top ("Hooch")</h4>
                        <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Your starter is hungry. Simply <strong>pour the hooch off</strong>
                            before feeding
                            as usual. If it happens often, feed more frequently.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Problem: Sluggish / Not Rising Much</h4>
                        <p><strong>Solution:</strong> <strong>Be patient!</strong> Ensure it's in a warm spot and
                            getting
                            fed regularly.
                            Consistency with strong white bread flour is key.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Problem: Runny Consistency</h4>
                        <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Double-check your measurements by weight. The target is a
                            <strong>thick
                                paste</strong>. If it's too thin, pour most off and feed again.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Problem: Funky Smells (Acetone, Vinegar, etc.)</h4>
                        <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Generally, <strong>ignore the smells unless you see visible
                                mould</strong>. If it smells strongly acidic, it's just hungry. Feed it. <strong>BUT, if
                                you see any pink, orange, or black fuzzy spots – discard immediately and start
                                over.</strong></p>
                    </li>
