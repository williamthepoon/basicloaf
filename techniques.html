        <h1>Key Sourdough Techniques Explained Simply</h1>
        <p>While the Basic Loaf recipe is designed for minimal fuss, understanding a few key techniques can help you get
            consistently great results or experiment further. Here's a simple breakdown.</p>

        <div class="page-toc" style="margin-bottom: 2em; padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-radius: 5px;">

            <h3>Stretch & Folds (Optional Strength Builders)</h3>
            <p>You might see "stretch and folds" mentioned a lot in sourdough recipes. So, what's the deal?</p>
            <h4>What are they?</h4>
            <p>Essentially, instead of traditional kneading, stretch and folds are a gentle way to develop gluten
                strength and structure in your wet sourdough dough. You're literally stretching a portion of the dough
                up and folding it over the rest.</p>
            <h4>Why do them?</h4>
            <p>They help create a strong gluten network which can trap the gas produced by the yeast, leading to a
                taller loaf with a potentially more open crumb structure (bigger holes). They incorporate air and
                equalize the dough temperature. The good news is that each set only takes about 30 seconds, so while
                optional, it doesn't add much hands-on time if you decide to try it.</p>
            <h4>Do I <em>need</em> to do them for the Basic Loaf recipe?</h4>
            <p>Honestly? <strong>No.</strong> This recipe is designed to work well with minimal handling, relying on the long, slow
                bulk fermentation to develop sufficient gluten. However, if you have the time and want to experiment,
                performing 2-4 sets during the first few hours of bulk fermentation (as mentioned in the recipe) <em>can</em>
                give your loaf a little extra boost in structure and height. It's totally optional though – don't feel
                pressured!</p>
            <h4>How to do a simple set:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Wet your hands slightly to prevent sticking.</li>
                <li>Reach under one side of the dough in the bowl.</li>
                <li>Gently stretch that portion upwards (without tearing it) and fold it over the top of the main dough
                    mass towards the opposite side.</li>
                <li>Rotate the bowl about 90 degrees (a quarter turn).</li>
                <li>Repeat the stretch and fold (reach under, stretch up, fold over).</li>
                <li>Repeat twice more, rotating the bowl each time, so you've stretched and folded from all four
                    "sides".</li>
                <li>That's one "set" done! Cover the bowl and wait 45-60 minutes before doing another set, if you choose
                    to.</li>
            </ol>

        <section id="shaping">
            <h3>Shaping Your Loaf (Building Tension)</h3>
            <p>Shaping is crucial! It's where you organize the fermented dough, creating surface tension – like pulling
                a skin tight over the loaf. This tension helps the dough hold its shape and rise upwards nicely in the
                oven (called "oven spring") instead of just spreading out.</p>
            <p>Here’s a simple method based on a letter fold, which works as a base for both round (boule) and oval
                (batard) loaves:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Prepare Surface:</strong> Lightly flour your work surface. <em>Lightly</em> is key – too much flour
                    prevents the dough from sticking to itself, making it harder to build tension.</li>
                <li><strong>Tip Out Dough:</strong> Gently tip your fermented dough out of its bowl onto the floured
                    surface. Try to keep the bubbly side up if possible.</li>
                <li><strong>Initial Shape & Degas Gently:</strong> Gently press the dough out into a rough square or
                    rectangle. Don't knock all the air out, just gently spread it.</li>
                <li><strong>Letter Fold:</strong> Imagine the rectangle divided into three vertical sections. Fold the
                    top third down over the middle third. Then, fold the bottom third up over the folded top third (like
                    folding a business letter). You now have a smaller, thicker rectangle or square.</li>
                <li><strong>Final Shape - Option A (Boule/Round):</strong> Follow steps for folding sides in and
                    rotating to form a tight ball.</li>
                <li><strong>Final Shape - Option B (Batard/Oval):</strong> Roll up the letter-folded dough tightly into
                    a log.</li>
                <li><strong>Transfer to Banneton:</strong> Place shaped dough seam-side UP into your prepared
                    banneton/bowl.</li>
            </ol>
        </section>

        <section id="scoring">
            <h3>Scoring Your Loaf (Keep it Simple!)</h3>
            <p>Scoring is making a deliberate cut on the top of your dough just before it goes into the oven. Why
                bother? It controls the rise and looks good!</p>
            <h4>The Simple Method:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Tool:</strong> Use something <em>very</em> sharp (lame, razor, sharp knife).</li>
                <li><strong>Timing:</strong> Score cold dough right before baking.</li>
                <li><strong>The Cut:</strong> Make <strong>one single, confident slash</strong> (straight or curved) about 1-2 cm
                    (1/2 inch) deep. Hold blade at a slight angle.</li>
                <li><strong>Confidence is Key:</strong> Be decisive to avoid dragging.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>One simple score is all you need for a great result!</p>

        <section id="freezing">
            <h3>Freezing Sourdough Bread (Yes, You Can!)</h3>
            <p>Baked too much? Or just want to save some for later? Sourdough freezes surprisingly well! The key is to
                do it properly to maintain quality.</p>
            <h4>Important First Step: Cool Completely!</h4>
            <p>Never freeze warm bread. Let your loaf cool <em>completely</em> on a wire rack (at least 2-4 hours, maybe
                longer) before wrapping and freezing. Freezing warm bread traps moisture leading to ice crystals and a
                potentially soggy thawed loaf.</p>

            <h4>Method 1: Freezing the Whole Loaf</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Best For:</strong> Preserving the overall moisture and texture if you plan to use the whole
                    loaf within a day or two after thawing.</li>
                <li><strong>How:</strong> Once completely cool, wrap the loaf tightly. Double wrapping is best: first in
                    cling film, then in a layer of aluminium foil or placed inside a large, airtight freezer bag.
                    Squeeze out as much air as possible.</li>
                <li><strong>Thawing:</strong> Leave wrapped at room temperature for several hours or overnight. To
                    refresh the crust, you can spritz it lightly with water and pop it into a hot oven (around 180-200°C
                    / 350-400°F) for 5-10 minutes.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Method 2: Freezing Slices</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Best For:</strong> Convenience! Perfect for grabbing individual slices for toast whenever
                    you fancy.</li>
                <li><strong>How:</strong> Once completely cool, slice the entire loaf. To prevent slices sticking
                    together, you can place squares of parchment paper between them, or lay them flat on a baking sheet
                    to freeze individually first before transferring to a freezer bag. Ensure the freezer bag is
                    airtight.</li>
                <li><strong>Thawing/Using:</strong> No need to thaw! You can toast slices directly from frozen. They
                    might need slightly longer in the toaster.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>General Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Wrap bread tightly and use airtight containers/bags to prevent freezer burn.</li>
                <li>Label and date your frozen bread.</li>
                <li>For best quality, use within 1-3 months. It's still safe after that but might lose some texture or
                    flavour.</li>
            </ul>
