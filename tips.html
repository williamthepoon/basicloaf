                <h3>Top 10 for Beginners</h3>
                <div class="tips-grid">
                    <div class="tip-card">
                        <span class="tip-number">1</span>
                        <p><strong>Know Your Rhythm:</strong> Get to know your starter by feeding it at the same time
                            every day to learn its unique rhythm and peak activity.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="tip-card">
                        <span class="tip-number">2</span>
                        <p><strong>Trust the Weight:</strong> Use a digital scale for every ingredient, as volume
                            measurements like cups are too inconsistent for the precision sourdough requires.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="tip-card">
                        <span class="tip-number">3</span>
                        <p><strong>Dough Over Clock:</strong> Watch the dough, not the clock, because ambient
                            temperature and starter strength will dictate fermentation speed more than a recipe’s
                            timeline.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="tip-card">
                        <span class="tip-number">4</span>
                        <p><strong>Handle with Care:</strong> Master the "stretch and fold" technique to build gluten
                            strength gently without degassing the delicate bubbles forming inside the dough.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="tip-card">
                        <span class="tip-number">5</span>
                        <p><strong>Control the Heat:</strong> Temperature is a literal ingredient, so aim for a
                            consistent bulk fermentation environment of around 24°C to 26°C for predictable results.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="tip-card">
                        <span class="tip-number">6</span>
                        <p><strong>The Power of Cold:</strong> Don't skimp on the cold proof; letting your shaped loaf
                            rest in the fridge overnight improves flavor and makes the dough easier to score.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="tip-card">
                        <span class="tip-number">7</span>
                        <p><strong>Trap the Steam:</strong> Invest in a Dutch oven to trap steam during the first half
                            of the bake, which is the secret to achieving a professional "oven spring" and crispy crust.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="tip-card">
                        <span class="tip-number">8</span>
                        <p><strong>Score Swiftly:</strong> Score with confidence using a swift, decisive shallow cut at
                            a 45-degree angle to control where the bread expands.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="tip-card">
                        <span class="tip-number">9</span>
                        <p><strong>The Hardest Wait:</strong> Wait before you slice at least two hours after baking, as
                            the internal structure is still "setting" and cutting early results in a gummy texture.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="tip-card">
                        <span class="tip-number">10</span>
                        <p><strong>Beautiful Failures:</strong> Embrace the "ugly" loaves, because even a flat or
                            over-proofed bread usually tastes delicious and provides the best data for your next bake.

                        <span class="tip-number">11</span>
                        <p><strong>Flour Quality:</strong> Use high quality strong white flour whenever possible, as the
                            higher protein content provides the structural support needed for a tall, airy crumb.</p>
                    </div>

                        <span class="tip-number">12</span>
                        <p><strong>The Discard Jar:</strong> Keep a "discard" jar in the fridge for the portion of
                            starter you don't use; it makes incredible pancakes, waffles, and crackers.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="tip-card">
                        <span class="tip-number">13</span>
                        <p><strong>The Autolyse:</strong> Autolyse your flour and water by mixing them 30 to 60 minutes
                            before adding salt to jumpstart gluten development and make the dough more extensible.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="tip-card">
                        <span class="tip-number">14</span>
                        <p><strong>Wet Hands:</strong> Wet your hands before handling the dough to prevent sticking
                            without adding extra flour, which can throw off your hydration levels.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="tip-card">
                        <span class="tip-number">15</span>
                        <p><strong>Transparent Proofing:</strong> Use a transparent straight-sided container for bulk
                            fermentation so you can easily see exactly when the dough has increased in volume by 50%.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="tip-card">
                        <span class="tip-number">16</span>
                        <p><strong>Extreme Preheating:</strong> Preheat your baking vessel for at least 45 to 60 minutes
                            at 230°C to 250°C to ensure the heat transfer is immediate the moment the dough hits the
                            surface.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="tip-card">
                        <span class="tip-number">17</span>
                        <p><strong>The Hollow Tap:</strong> Test for "doneness" with sound by tapping the bottom of the
                            loaf; it should sound hollow, or use a thermometer to check for an internal temp of about
                            98°C.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="tip-card">
                        <span class="tip-number">18</span>
                        <p><strong>Peak Performance:</strong> Feed your starter "peak to peak"—if you want a less sour
                            bread, use your starter right when it hits its highest point before it begins to fall.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="tip-card">
                        <span class="tip-number">19</span>
                        <p><strong>Baking Journal:</strong> Document your bakes in a simple notebook, noting the room
                            temperature, timings, and flour types so you can replicate your wins.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="tip-card">
                        <span class="tip-number">20</span>
                        <p><strong>Zero Waste:</strong> Repurpose your "fails" by turning flat or dense loaves into
                            golden croutons, breadcrumbs, or a rich Panzanella salad—nothing is ever truly wasted.</p>
