                <h4>Day 1: Mixing &amp; Proofing</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Combine Ingredients (Morning):</strong> In a large bowl, combine your 75-100g active
                        starter with 180g lukewarm water and mix well. Then add 5g salt and the 280g strong bread flour.
                        Use your hands or a sturdy spoon to mix everything roughly until no dry flour remains. It will
                        look like a shaggy, messy ball – that's perfect! Cover the bowl (with cling film, a shower cap,
                        or a plate).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Short Rest &amp; Mix:</strong> Let the covered bowl sit for about 10-15 minutes. Then,
                        spend just 1 minute using wet hands to gently fold the dough over itself in the bowl, or use
                        your spoon/spatula to bring it together more uniformly. It doesn't need kneading, just make sure
                        it's a bit more cohesive than the initial shaggy mass. Cover again.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Bulk Fermentation (The Wait):</strong> Now, leave the covered
                        bowl at room temperature. We're looking for the dough to grow and become airy. In a warm
                        kitchen, this might take 4 hours. In a cool Irish kitchen in winter, it could be 6 or 8 hours.
                        Watch the dough, not the clock. You want it to look puffy, wobble when you shake the bowl, and
                        increase in size by about 50-75%.
                        <p><strong>Optional: Stretch &amp; Folds:</strong> If you're around and fancy it, you can
                            perform 2-4 sets of stretch and folds during the first 3-4 hours of fermentation. To do
                            this: with wet hands, reach under one side of the dough, gently stretch it upwards, and fold
                            it over the top. Rotate the bowl 90 degrees and repeat 3 more times (total 4 stretches/folds
                            per set). Wait 45-60 minutes between sets. This builds strength but is <em>optional</em> for
                            this
                            recipe. <a href="techniques.html#stretch-fold">Learn more about Stretch & Folds</a>.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Shape:</strong> Once the dough looks ready (increased size), gently tip it out onto a
                        lightly floured worktop. Gently press the dough out slightly into a rough rectangle. Fold the
                        top third down, the bottom third up (like a letter), then fold the left third over and the right
                        third over. Flip it over so the seams are underneath and gently cup your hands around the dough,
                        rotating it on the counter to create surface tension and form a round ball (boule) or an oval
                        (batard). Don't handle it too roughly – keep the air inside! <a

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Prepare Banneton &amp; Final Proof Prep:</strong> Generously dust your banneton (or a
                        medium bowl lined with a clean, non-fluffy tea towel) with rice flour. Rice flour is key as it
                        doesn't absorb moisture like regular flour, preventing sticking. Gently place the shaped dough
                        into the banneton, seam-side facing UP.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Counter Proof:</strong> Cover the banneton (a plastic bag or shower cap works well).
                        Leave it on your worktop at room temperature for 1-2 hours. It might puff up slightly more.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Cold Proof (Overnight):</strong> Transfer the covered banneton to the fridge. Let it
                        rest and develop flavour overnight. You can leave it longer, up to 24 hours if needed.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h4>Day 2: Baking</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Preheat Oven &amp; Dutch Oven:</strong> When you're ready to bake, place your <a
                            href="gear.html#must-haves">Dutch oven</a>
                        (with its lid on) inside your main oven. Preheat the oven to 235°C (455°F). It's crucial the
                        Dutch oven gets incredibly hot, so let it preheat for at least 20 minutes <em>after</em> the
                        oven
                        reaches temperature (30 - 40 mins total preheat time is ideal).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Prepare Dough for Baking:</strong> Just before you bake, take the banneton out of the
                        fridge. Place a piece of baking parchment paper over the top of the banneton, then quickly and
                        carefully flip the whole thing over so the dough releases onto the parchment paper. Lift off the
                        banneton/bowl.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Score the Loaf:</strong> Using a baker's lame or a sharp knife, make one confident,
                        decisive score across the top of the loaf (about 1-2 cm or 1/2 inch deep). A simple curve or a
                        cross works well for beginners. This allows the bread to expand when baking. <a

                        <strong>Bake (Lid On):</strong> Carefully take the <em>very hot</em> Dutch oven out of the oven.
                        Remove
                        the lid. Using the parchment paper as a sling, carefully lower your scored dough into the hot
                        Dutch oven. Put the lid back on immediately. Place the Dutch oven back into the main oven. Bake
                        for <strong>25 minutes</strong>.

                        <strong>Bake (Lid Off):</strong> After 25 minutes, carefully remove the Dutch oven lid (be
                        cautious of steam!). Reduce the oven temperature to 220°C (430°F). Continue baking with the lid
                        <em>off</em> for another <strong>20 minutes</strong>, or until the crust is a deep golden brown
                        colour and feels
                        firm.

                        <strong>Cool Completely:</strong> Using oven gloves, carefully lift the baked loaf out of the
                        Dutch oven (you can use the parchment paper) and place it on a wire rack. Now for the hardest
                        part: let it cool completely! This takes <em>at least</em> 30 to 60 minutes, ideally longer.
                        Slicing
                        into hot bread can result in a gummy texture as the inside is still setting. Patience here is
                        rewarded!

                        <strong>Enjoy!</strong> Your bread is ready to go! Check out my ideas page for some ideas on
                        sandwich fillings and other uses for your bread. You can also freeze any leftovers (if there are
                        any!) for later use. Just slice it first, then wrap it tightly in cling film or foil and place
                        it in a freezer bag. When you're ready to eat, just take out a slice and toast it straight from
                        frozen!
