        <h1>What to Do with Sourdough Bread: Ideas for Every Loaf</h1>
        <p>You've <a href="recipe.html">baked the bread</a>. Now what? Apart from eating half of it warm with butter (which is highly
            recommended), here are some ideas for using up the rest of your sourdough bread - whether it's fresh out of
            the oven or starting to go a bit stale. Sourdough's tangy flavour and sturdy crumb make it one of the most
            versatile breads in the kitchen.</p>

            <h2>Ideas for Fresh Sourdough</h2>
            <p>That first day or two is when the crust is crisp and the crumb is perfect. Make the most of it!</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Classic Toast & Butter:</strong> Don't underestimate the simple things. A thick slice,
                    toasted just right, with lashings of good Irish butter. Perfection.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>The Humble Sandwich:</strong> Your amazing homemade bread deserves better than pre-packaged
                    fillings. Load it up with your favourites – a classic ham & cheese, a Ploughman's, tuna mayo, egg
                    salad, you name it. The slight tang of sourdough pairs well with almost anything.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Avocado Toast (Elevated):</strong> Mash some avocado with salt, pepper, and maybe a squeeze
                    of lime. Spread it on toast. Now level it up: add chilli flakes, feta cheese, a poached egg, smoked
                    salmon, cherry tomatoes, or toasted seeds.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Fancy Toasts:</strong> Think beyond avocado. Try ricotta cheese with honey and walnuts;
                    sautéed mushrooms with garlic and herbs; roasted tomatoes with basil; or even just good olive oil
                    and sea salt.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Dipping Duty:</strong> Thick slices are perfect for mopping up hearty soups, stews, or
                    chili. Also great with olive oil and balsamic vinegar for dipping.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Grilled Cheese / Toastie:</strong> Sourdough makes the <em>best</em> grilled cheese
                    sandwiches. The
                    sturdy crumb holds up well, and the tangy flavour complements sharp cheddar or gooey mozzarella
                    beautifully.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Cheese / Charcuterie Board Star:</strong> Slice your fresh loaf and serve it alongside your
                    favourite cheeses, cured meats, olives, and chutneys. It's the perfect vehicle for all those
                    delicious flavours.

            <h2>Creative Uses for Stale Sourdough Bread</h2>
            <p>Sourdough actually keeps quite well, but after a few days, it might start to feel a bit firm or dry.
                Don't throw it out! Stale sourdough is incredibly versatile. First, if you know you won't eat it all,
                check out our guide on <a href="advice.html#freezing">Freezing Sourdough Bread</a>.</p>
            <p>But if you do have stale bread, here are some great uses:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Homemade Croutons:</strong> Cube stale bread. For oven croutons, toss with olive oil, salt,
                    pepper, garlic powder, and herbs (oregano/rosemary work well). Bake at 180°C/350°F until golden and
                    crunchy. For a quicker version, pan-fry the oiled cubes in a skillet over medium heat, tossing
                    frequently until crisp.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Versatile Breadcrumbs:</strong> Blitz dried-out stale bread in a food processor until you
                    get crumbs. For "fresh" breadcrumbs (good for stuffing), use bread that's just a day or two old. For
                    dried crumbs, toast the bread slices in a low oven first until completely dry, then blitz. Store in
                    an airtight container or freeze.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>The Best French Toast:</strong> Stale sourdough is fantastic for French toast as it soaks up
                    the egg mixture without falling apart.
                    <ul>
                        <li><em>Sweet:</em> For two slices, whisk 1 egg, a splash of milk (about 60ml), 1/2 tsp vanilla
                            extract, and 1/2 tsp cinnamon. Dip thick slices until saturated but not soggy. Fry in butter
                            over medium heat until golden brown.</li>
                        <li><em>Savoury:</em> Whisk 1 egg with a splash of milk, salt, and pepper. Dip and fry as above.
                            Great with bacon, mushrooms, or melted cheese on top.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Panzanella (Tuscan Bread Salad):</strong> Tear stale bread into chunks. Toast lightly.
                    Combine in a large bowl with ripe chopped tomatoes, cucumber, thinly sliced red onion, and lots of
                    fresh basil. Whisk together olive oil, red wine vinegar, salt, and pepper for a simple vinaigrette.
                    Pour over, toss gently, and let it sit for at least 20 minutes for the bread to soak up the juices.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Bruschetta or Crostini:</strong> Slice the loaf, brush with olive oil, and toast or grill
                    until crisp. Rub a raw garlic clove over the surface while warm. Top with anything you like: chopped
                    tomatoes and basil, goat cheese and roasted peppers, or white bean dip.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Ribollita (Tuscan Bean & Bread Soup):</strong> A classic rustic soup. The basic idea is to
                    make a hearty vegetable and bean soup (with things like cannellini beans, kale, carrots, celery,
                    onion, tomatoes). You then layer slices of stale sourdough in serving bowls and ladle the hot soup
                    over the top, letting the bread soak it all up.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Stuffing or Dressing:</strong> The firm texture of stale sourdough makes it a fantastic base
                    for stuffing. Cube the bread and let it dry out a bit more if needed. Sauté onions and celery, then
                    combine with the bread cubes, herbs like sage and thyme, and chicken or vegetable stock.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Savory Strata:</strong> A strata is like a savoury bread pudding. Layer stale bread cubes in
                    a baking dish with cheese, cooked vegetables (like spinach, mushrooms, or peppers), and maybe some
                    sausage or bacon. Pour a mixture of eggs and milk over everything and let it soak for a while before
                    baking until golden and set.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Fondue Dippers:</strong> If you're having a cheese fondue night, sturdy cubes of toasted
                    stale sourdough are the absolute best for dipping. They hold their shape and have enough flavour to
                    stand up to the cheese.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Common Questions</h2>

            <h3>How long does homemade sourdough bread last?</h3>
            <p>Stored at room temperature in a bread bag or wrapped in a clean tea towel, sourdough keeps well for 3-5
                days. The natural acidity acts as a preservative - one of the real advantages over commercially-made
                bread. After a couple of days the crust softens, but the flavour often improves. If you know you won't
                eat it all within 5 days, slice it and freeze it.</p>

            <h3>Can you freeze sourdough bread?</h3>
            <p>Yes, and it freezes very well. Slice the whole loaf before freezing so you can take out individual slices
                as needed. Wrap tightly in clingfilm or a freezer bag - it keeps for up to 3 months. Thaw slices at room
                temperature for 30-40 minutes, or toast straight from frozen.</p>

            <h3>How do you revive stale sourdough bread?</h3>
            <p>Run the whole loaf briefly under cold water so the crust is damp (don't soak it), then bake at
                <strong>200°C / 400°F</strong> for <strong>8-10 minutes</strong>. The steam from the water revives the
                crumb and crisps the crust back up. It won't be exactly like fresh, but it's surprisingly effective.</p>
