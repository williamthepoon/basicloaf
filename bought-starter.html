      <p>First of all, <strong>thank you</strong> for choosing my sourdough starter. You've just
        skipped the most challenging 14 days of the sourdough journey! This starter is <strong>over 5 years
          old</strong>, used daily to bake for Will's family, and is incredibly resilient and reliable.</p>

      <p>Whether you received a fresh starter or a packet of dried flakes, find your version below. Either way, you're
        just a few days away from your first loaf.</p>

        <h3>If You Received Dried Flakes</h3>
        <p>Bringing a dried starter back to life is simple - it just takes a bit of patience. All you need is strong
          white bread flour and lukewarm water.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Day 1 - The Awakening:</strong> In a clean jar, mix <strong>25g of the flakes</strong> with
            <strong>25g of lukewarm water</strong>. Leave it for about an hour so the flakes can soften into a paste,
            then stir in <strong>25g of flour</strong>. It should be a thick, rough paste - don't worry if it looks a
            little lumpy at this stage. Cover loosely and leave in a warm spot for <strong>24 hours</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Day 2 - First Signs of Life:</strong> You might see a couple of tiny bubbles today - that's exactly
            what we want. Don't discard anything yet. Just stir in <strong>50g flour</strong> and <strong>50g lukewarm
              water</strong>, give it a good mix, and leave for another <strong>24 hours</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Day 3 - Back in Business:</strong> It should be smelling pleasantly tangy by now. Discard about half
            of what's in the jar, then feed it again with <strong>50g flour</strong> and <strong>50g water</strong>.
            Within a few hours it should be bubbly, active, and starting to double in size.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Once it's reliably doubling within <strong>4-8 hours</strong> of a feed, it has officially moved in! If it
          needs another day or two, just repeat the Day 3 feed until it gets there - dried starters can sometimes take a
          little longer depending on the temperature in your kitchen. Check out the <a href="starter.html">Starter
            Guide</a> for long-term feeding and storage from here.</p>

      <section id="collected">
        <h3>If You Collected Your Starter in Person</h3>
        <p>Since you picked this up directly, the starter is likely very happy and active.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>collected after 4pm?</strong> chances are I've already fed it for you.</li>
          <li><strong>Baking Tomorrow?</strong> I recommend giving it a feed this evening (around 5-6pm). It
            will then be bubbly, active, and ready to bake with first thing in the morning.</li>
          <li><strong>Baking Later?</strong> If you aren't baking straight away, pop the jar into the fridge.
            When you are ready to bake, take it out <strong>the day before</strong> and give it a boost.
            Check out my guide on <a href="starter.html#strengthening-starter">How to Strengthen Your
              Starter</a>.</li>

      <section id="posted">
        <h3>If You Received Your Starter by Post</h3>
        <p>Being in an envelope for 24-48 hours is a journey! Your starter might arrive
          looking a bit thin or smelling quite "vinegary" and intense. <strong>Don't worry - it's just hungry
            and tired.</strong></p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Feed Immediately:</strong> Treat your starter to a fresh meal. Snip the end of the zip
            lock bag like a piping back and squeeze it into a clear, sterilized jar. Give it a "1:1:1" feed
            (70g starter, 70g lukewarm water, 70g strong white bread
            flour). </li>
          <li><strong>The Sensory Check:</strong> Mix it into a <strong>thick, sticky paste</strong> (like
            thick peanut butter). Within a few hours, you should smell a wonderful transformation: from
            sharp vinegar to a <strong>pleasant, tangy sweetness</strong>. (See my <a
              href="starter.html#feeding-method">Feeding Guide</a> for more).</li>
          <li><strong>The Double Check:</strong> I recommend feeding it twice at room temperature before your
            first bake. You want to see it reliably <strong>doubling in volume</strong> and becoming light
            and airy, like a marshmallow.</li>
          <li><strong>Storage:</strong> Once it's bubbly and active, it has officially moved in! You can move
            it to the fridge and follow the standard maintenance in the <a href="starter.html">Starter
              Guide</a>.</li>

        <h3>A Few Tips for My Specific Starter</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>It Loves Warmth:</strong> This culture is used to a cozy kitchen. If your house is cool,
            use lukewarm water (35°C) for feedings to keep it moving.</li>
          <li><strong>Don't Overthink It:</strong> Sourdough is resilient. If you forget a feed, just give it
            some flour and water and it will almost always bounce back.</li>
          <li><strong>Ready to Bake?</strong> Once your starter is bubbly and active, head over to <a
              href="recipe.html">The Recipe</a> to start your first Basic Loaf.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you have any issues or want to show off your first loaf, tag me on Instagram <a
            href="https://instagram.com/william_the_poon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@william_the_poon</a>!</p>

        <div class="pro-tip"
          style="background: #e6f7ff; border-left: 4px solid #1890ff; padding: 1em; margin-top: 1em;">
          <strong>Pro Tip: The Backup Jar</strong><br>
          Once your starter is active, take a small spoonful (10g) and put it in a separate small jar in the
          fridge. Don't feed it, just leave it there. This is your "insurance policy" in case anything happens
          to your main jar!

        <h3>New Starter FAQs</h3>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h4>Is the smell normal?</h4>
          <p>Yes! It might smell like vinegar, yeast, or even a bit fruity. This is completely normal for a
            mature culture. Only worry if you see fuzzy mould.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h4>What if it looks liquid or thin?</h4>
          <p>Temperature changes during travel can make the starter go thin. Simply feed it with equal parts
            flour and water (by weight) to bring it back to a thick paste consistency.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h4>When can I bake?</h4>
          <p>Once your starter is reliably doubling in size within 4-8 hours after a feed, you are ready to
            bake! Check out <a href="recipe.html">The Recipe</a> to get started.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h4>My dried flakes aren't doing much by Day 3 - is that normal?</h4>
          <p>Fairly common, especially in a cooler kitchen. Just repeat the Day 3 feed (discard half, add 50g flour and
            50g water) until you see reliable bubbling and doubling - some dried starters take 4-5 days. The biggest
            factor is warmth, so try finding a warmer spot if it's being sluggish.</p>
