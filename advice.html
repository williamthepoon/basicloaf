            <h2>Part 1: Key Techniques</h2>
            <p>While the Basic Loaf recipe is designed for minimal fuss, understanding a few key techniques can help you
                get consistently great results.</p>

            <section id="stretch-fold">
                <h3>Stretch & Folds (Optional Strength Builders)</h3>
                <p>You see these mentioned a lot. They aren't strictly necessary for this recipe, but they can help if
                    you
                    want to get technical.</p>
                <h4>What are they?</h4>
                <p>Essentially, instead of traditional kneading, stretch and folds are a gentle way to develop gluten
                    strength and structure in your wet sourdough dough. You're literally stretching a portion of the
                    dough
                    up and folding it over the rest.</p>
                <h4>Why do them?</h4>
                <p>They help create a strong gluten network which can trap the gas produced by the yeast, leading to a
                    taller loaf with a potentially more open crumb structure (bigger holes). They incorporate air and
                    equalize the dough temperature. The good news is that each set only takes about 30 seconds, so while
                    optional, it doesn't add much hands-on time if you decide to try it.</p>
                <h4>Do I <em>need</em> to do them for the Basic Loaf recipe?</h4>
                <p>Honestly? <strong>No.</strong> This recipe is designed to work well with minimal handling, relying on
                    the
                    long, slow
                    bulk fermentation to develop sufficient gluten. However, if you have the time and want to
                    experiment,
                    performing 2-4 sets during the first few hours of bulk fermentation (as mentioned in the recipe)
                    <em>can</em>
                    give your loaf a little extra boost in structure and height. It's totally optional though – don't
                    feel
                    pressured!
                </p>
                <h4>How to do a simple set:</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Wet your hands slightly to prevent sticking.</li>
                    <li>Reach under one side of the dough in the bowl.</li>
                    <li>Gently stretch that portion upwards (without tearing it) and fold it over the top of the main
                        dough
                        mass towards the opposite side.</li>
                    <li>Rotate the bowl about 90 degrees (a quarter turn).</li>
                    <li>Repeat the stretch and fold (reach under, stretch up, fold over).</li>
                    <li>Repeat twice more, rotating the bowl each time, so you've stretched and folded from all four
                        "sides".</li>
                    <li>That's one "set" done! Cover the bowl and wait 45-60 minutes before doing another set, if you
                        choose
                        to.</li>
                </ol>

            <section id="shaping">
                <h3>Shaping Your Loaf (Building Tension)</h3>
                <p>Shaping isn't just about making it round. It's about creating "surface tension" - tightening the outer
                    skin
                    of the dough so it holds its shape and rises upwards in the oven.</p>
                <p>Here’s a simple method based on a letter fold, which works as a base for both round (boule) and oval
                    (batard) loaves:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Prepare Surface:</strong> Lightly flour your work surface. <em>Lightly</em> is key – too
                        much flour
                        prevents the dough from sticking to itself, making it harder to build tension.</li>
                    <li><strong>Tip Out Dough:</strong> Gently tip your fermented dough out of its bowl onto the floured
                        surface. Try to keep the bubbly side up if possible.</li>
                    <li><strong>Initial Shape & Degas Gently:</strong> Gently press the dough out into a rough square or
                        rectangle. Don't knock all the air out, just gently spread it.</li>
                    <li><strong>Letter Fold:</strong> Imagine the rectangle divided into three vertical sections. Fold
                        the
                        top third down over the middle third. Then, fold the bottom third up over the folded top third
                        (like
                        folding a business letter). You now have a smaller, thicker rectangle or square.</li>
                    <li><strong>Final Shape - Option A (Boule/Round):</strong> Follow steps for folding sides in and
                        rotating to form a tight ball.</li>
                    <li><strong>Final Shape - Option B (Batard/Oval):</strong> Roll up the letter-folded dough tightly
                        into
                        a log.</li>
                    <li><strong>Transfer to Banneton:</strong> Place shaped dough seam-side UP into your prepared
                        banneton/bowl.</li>
                </ol>
            </section>

            <section id="scoring">
                <h3>Scoring Your Loaf (Keep it Simple!)</h3>
                <p>Scoring is making a deliberate cut on the top of your dough just before it goes into the oven. Why
                    bother? It controls the rise and looks good!</p>
                <h4>The Simple Method:</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Tool:</strong> Use something <em>very</em> sharp (lame, razor, sharp knife).</li>
                    <li><strong>Timing:</strong> Score cold dough right before baking.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Cut:</strong> Make <strong>one single, confident slash</strong> (straight or curved)
                        about 1-2 cm
                        (1/2 inch) deep. Hold blade at a slight angle.</li>
                    <li><strong>Confidence is Key:</strong> Be decisive to avoid dragging.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>One simple score is all you need for a great result!</p>

            <section id="freezing">
                <h3>Freezing Sourdough Bread (Yes, You Can!)</h3>
                <p>Baked too much? Or just want to save some for later? Sourdough freezes surprisingly well! The key is
                    to
                    do it properly to maintain quality.</p>
                <h4>Important First Step: Cool Completely!</h4>
                <p>Never freeze warm bread. Let your loaf cool <em>completely</em> on a wire rack (at least 2-4 hours,
                    maybe
                    longer) before wrapping and freezing. Freezing warm bread traps moisture leading to ice crystals and
                    a
                    potentially soggy thawed loaf.</p>

                <h4>Method 1: Freezing the Whole Loaf</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Best For:</strong> Preserving the overall moisture and texture if you plan to use the
                        whole
                        loaf within a day or two after thawing.</li>
                    <li><strong>How:</strong> Once completely cool, wrap the loaf tightly. Double wrapping is best:
                        first in
                        cling film, then in a layer of aluminium foil or placed inside a large, airtight freezer bag.
                        Squeeze out as much air as possible.</li>
                    <li><strong>Thawing:</strong> Leave wrapped at room temperature for several hours or overnight. To
                        refresh the crust, you can spritz it lightly with water and pop it into a hot oven (around
                        180-200°C
                        / 350-400°F) for 5-10 minutes.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Method 2: Freezing Slices</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Best For:</strong> Convenience! Perfect for grabbing individual slices for toast
                        whenever
                        you fancy.</li>
                    <li><strong>How:</strong> Once completely cool, slice the entire loaf. To prevent slices sticking
                        together, you can place squares of parchment paper between them, or lay them flat on a baking
                        sheet
                        to freeze individually first before transferring to a freezer bag. Ensure the freezer bag is
                        airtight.</li>
                    <li><strong>Thawing/Using:</strong> No need to thaw! You can toast slices directly from frozen. They
                        might need slightly longer in the toaster.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>General Tips:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Wrap bread tightly and use airtight containers/bags to prevent freezer burn.</li>
                    <li>Label and date your frozen bread.</li>
                    <li>For best quality, use within 1-3 months. It's still safe after that but might lose some texture
                        or
                        flavour.</li>
                </ul>

                        <p><strong>Know Your Rhythm:</strong> Get to know your starter by feeding it at the same time
                            every day to learn its unique rhythm and peak activity.</p>
                    </div>

                        <p><strong>Trust the Weight:</strong> Use a digital scale for every ingredient, as volume
                            measurements like cups are too inconsistent for the precision sourdough requires.</p>
                    </div>

                        <p><strong>Dough Over Clock:</strong> Watch the dough, not the clock, because ambient
                            temperature and starter strength will dictate fermentation speed more than a recipe’s
                            timeline.</p>

                        <p><strong>Handle with Care:</strong> Master the "stretch and fold" technique to build gluten
                            strength gently without degassing the delicate bubbles forming inside the dough.</p>

                        <p><strong>Control the Heat:</strong> Temperature is a literal ingredient, so aim for a
                            consistent bulk fermentation environment of around 24°C to 26°C for predictable results.</p>

                        <p><strong>The Power of Cold:</strong> Don't skimp on the cold proof; letting your shaped loaf
                            rest in the fridge overnight improves flavor and makes the dough easier to score.</p>

                        <p><strong>Trap the Steam:</strong> Invest in a Dutch oven to trap steam during the first half
                            of the bake, which is the secret to achieving a professional "oven spring" and crispy crust.

                        <p><strong>Score Swiftly:</strong> Score with confidence using a swift, decisive shallow cut at
                            a 45-degree angle to control where the bread expands.</p>
                    </div>

                        <p><strong>The Hardest Wait:</strong> Wait before you slice at least two hours after baking, as
                            the internal structure is still "setting" and cutting early results in a gummy texture.</p>
                    </div>

                        <p><strong>Beautiful Failures:</strong> Embrace the "ugly" loaves, because even a flat or
                            over-proofed bread usually tastes delicious and provides the best data for your next bake.

                        <span class="tip-number">11</span>
                        <p><strong>Flour Quality:</strong> Use high quality strong white flour whenever possible, as the
                            higher protein content provides the structural support needed for a tall, airy crumb.</p>
                    </div>

                        <p><strong>The Discard Jar:</strong> Keep a "discard" jar in the fridge for the portion of
                            starter you don't use; it makes incredible pancakes, waffles, and crackers.</p>
                    </div>

                        <p><strong>The Autolyse:</strong> Autolyse your flour and water by mixing them 30 to 60 minutes
                            before adding salt to jumpstart gluten development and make the dough more extensible.</p>

                        <p><strong>Wet Hands:</strong> Wet your hands before handling the dough to prevent sticking
                            without adding extra flour, which can throw off your hydration levels.</p>
                    </div>

                        <p><strong>Transparent Proofing:</strong> Use a transparent straight-sided container for bulk
                            fermentation so you can easily see exactly when the dough has increased in volume by 50%.
                        </p>

                        <p><strong>Extreme Preheating:</strong> Preheat your baking vessel for at least 45 to 60 minutes
                            at 230°C to 250°C to ensure the heat transfer is immediate the moment the dough hits the
                            surface.</p>

                        <p><strong>The Hollow Tap:</strong> Test for "doneness" with sound by tapping the bottom of the
                            loaf; it should sound hollow, or use a thermometer to check for an internal temp of about
                            98°C.</p>

                        <p><strong>Peak Performance:</strong> Feed your starter "peak to peak" - if you want a less sour
                            bread, use your starter right when it hits its highest point before it begins to fall.</p>

                        <p><strong>Baking Journal:</strong> Document your bakes in a simple notebook, noting the room
                            temperature, timings, and flour types so you can replicate your wins.</p>
                    </div>

                        <p><strong>Zero Waste:</strong> Repurpose your "fails" by turning flat or dense loaves into
                            golden croutons, breadcrumbs, or a rich Panzanella salad - nothing is ever truly wasted.</p>
